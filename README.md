# MSProfiler Database Manipulation

This repository contains code for manipulating the MSProfiler database using a Shiny web application. The application allows users to add, delete, and query samples in the database, as well as visualize the data through interactive plots.

# Features
## Adding samples: 
Upload a CSV file containing samples and add them to the database.

## Deleting a sample: 
Enter the name of a sample to delete it from the database.

## Interrogating the database: 
Enter specific filter criteria such as sample name, family, genus, species, etc., to query the database.

## Visualization: 
Interactive plots are generated to visualize the distribution of samples based on different attributes such as family, genus, body part, and arthropod type.
